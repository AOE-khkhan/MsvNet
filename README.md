### Introduction
The MsvNet is a novel learning-based feature recognition method using multiple sectional view representation. At the time of its release, the MsvNet achieves the state-of-the-art single feature recognition results by using only a few training samples, and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based multi-feature recognition method in terms of recognition performances.

### Single feature recognition

1. Prerequisites: python 3.+, pytorch, torchvision, numpy, cupy, 
2. Download the FeatureNet dataset, and convert them into voxel models via binvox
3. Run single.py

### Multi-feature recognition
